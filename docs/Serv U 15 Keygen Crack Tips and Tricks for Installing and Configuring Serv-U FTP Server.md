## New Serv-U Web Client
 
One of the most noticeable changes in Serv-U File Server 15 is the new Serv-U Web Client, which replaces the old Java-based web client. The new web client offers a modern and intuitive user interface that does not require Java installation or browser plugins. You can access your files from any web browser on any device, and enjoy features such as:
 
- Drag and drop support for uploads
- Multiple file and folder upload / zip download
- File sharing with expiration dates and passwords (MFT only)

You can also choose to use the legacy web client if you prefer, by selecting the option in the domain settings.
 
## TLS 1.3 Support
 
Serv-U File Server 15 also supports TLS 1.3, the latest version of the Transport Layer Security protocol that provides enhanced security and performance for encrypted connections. TLS 1.3 offers benefits such as:

- Faster handshake and connection establishment
- Improved resistance to replay attacks and downgrade attacks
- Forward secrecy by default
- Support for newer and stronger cipher suites

To enable TLS 1.3, you need to upgrade your OpenSSL library to version 3.0.2 or higher, and configure your SSL/TLS settings accordingly.
 
## Server Identity Feature
 
Serv-U File Server 15 also introduces the concept of Server Identity, which is a unique identifier that consists of a Server UID and a secret key. This feature enhances the security of your server by providing stronger encryption for third-party passwords, such as those used for LDAP authentication or email notifications. You can also share your Server Identity among multiple instances of Serv-U File Server that have the same server definition, for example, in a load balancing scenario.
 
To create, export or import your Server Identity, you can use the new options in the Server Details section of the Serv-U Management Console.
 
## Other Improvements and Fixes
 
In addition to these major features, Serv-U File Server 15 also includes several other improvements and fixes, such as:

- A new option to log zipped download events
- A new default certificate generated during installation in the Windows Certificate store
- A transition to Network Service account from Local System account for improved security
- A removal of vulnerable encryption types other than one-way encryption for passwords
- A fix for RFC compliance issue with carriage return and line feed characters
- An update of jQuery library to version 3.6.0
