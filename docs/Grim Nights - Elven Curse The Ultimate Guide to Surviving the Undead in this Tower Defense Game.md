This DLC adds a new map, a new enemy type, and a new game mode to Grim Nights. You will have to face the wrath of the elves, who have been corrupted by a dark curse and are now attacking your village with their magic and arrows. You will also have to deal with a new threat: the elven dragon, a powerful beast that can fly over your walls and breathe fire on your buildings.
 
The new game mode is called Elven Invasion. In this mode, you will have to survive as long as possible against endless waves of elven attackers. You will have to manage your resources, build your defenses, and recruit new villagers to fight for you. The longer you survive, the harder it gets.

One of the main features of Grim Nights is the underground exploration. You can dig tunnels under your village and find valuable resources, such as gold, iron, and gems. However, you also have to face dangers, such as cave-ins, traps, and monsters. You can use your villagers to mine the resources and bring them back to the surface, or you can hire mercenaries to do the job for you. The underground is randomly generated every time you start a new game, so you never know what you will find.
 
Another feature of Grim Nights is the unit customization. You can train your villagers to become different types of soldiers, such as archers, swordsmen, mages, and healers. Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you have to use them wisely to defend your village. You can also equip your units with different weapons and armor that you can craft or buy from merchants. You can also assign your units to different tasks, such as farming, hunting, building, or patrolling.
 
Grim Nights also has a day and night cycle that affects the gameplay. During the day, you can focus on building your village, gathering resources, and exploring the underground. During the night, you have to prepare for the enemy attacks that will come from different directions. The enemies will become stronger and more numerous as the game progresses, and you will have to face bosses that will test your defenses. You can also use torches and traps to light up the darkness and slow down the enemies.
